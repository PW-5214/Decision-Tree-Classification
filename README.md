## 📌 Project Overview

This notebook demonstrates:

- Loading and exploring the dataset
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Splitting into training and test sets
- Building a Decision Tree Classifier
- Evaluating with accuracy and confusion matrix
- Hyperparameter tuning with `GridSearchCV`
- Visualizing model performance

---

## 🧰 Libraries Used

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `sklearn` (scikit-learn)
